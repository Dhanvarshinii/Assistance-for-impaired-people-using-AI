## Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 40 million people worldwide are blind, with another 250 million experiencing vision impairments, making independent navigation a significant challenge. This project leverages advancements in Deep Learning using TensorFlow's Object Detection API to help visually impaired individuals recognize and classify objects, providing distance-based voice feedback. The goal is to create an integrated Machine Learning framework that improves navigation safety and independence, deployable on mobile devices.

## Features
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Identifies and classifies multiple objects in the environment.
- **Distance Measurement**: Calculates the distance to objects and provides warnings if they are too close or too far.
- **Voice Feedback**: Describes detected objects and provides navigational assistance through audio.
- **TensorFlow Object Detection API**: Utilizes pre-trained models for object recognition.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow and TensorFlow Object Detection API**
- **OpenCV**
- **Mobile Sensors (e.g., Camera, Ultrasonic Sensor for distance)**
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) API for voice feedback**
